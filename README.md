# Efficient-Algorithms-Project

1. Introduction
The program simulates the problem of finding the shortest path from a Start Node to an End Node (points A to B). 
For solving this problem, the program uses three graph algorithms Depth First Search (DFS), Breath First Search (BFS), and Dijkstra.

2. How to use
2.1 Selecting the Algorithm for Solving the Problem

In the top left corner, the program shows the current algorithm used for solving the problem, pressing the ‘Alt’ key on the keyboard will change the algorithm.

2.2 Placing a Start Node

Hovering the mouse over a cell and pressing the ‘S’ key on the keyboard will place a Start Node.

2.3 Placing an End Node

Hovering the mouse over a cell and pressing the ‘E’ key on the keyboard will place an End Node.

2.4 Adding Obstacles

Hovering over cells and pressing and holding the ‘Left mouse button’ will add obstacles to the hovered cells.

2.4 Adding Junctions
Hovering over cells and pressing and holding the ‘Right mouse button’ will add a junction on the hovered cells.

2.4 Removing Cells
Hovering over cells and pressing and holding the “Shift” key will remove cells.

2.5 Running the Program
Only after setting the Start Node and End Node, the user can run the program. Pressing the “Enter”
key will run the program with the selected algorithm (look at 2.1 for how to select an algorithm).

2.6 Restarting
After running the program, you can restart the program by Pressing the “R” key.

2.7 Exiting the Program
Pressing the "Esc” key will exit the program.
